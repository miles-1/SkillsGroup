In the book The Old Man and the Sea, Ernest Hemingway tells the story of an old Cuban fisherman named
Santiago who, considered by the villagers to be the worst type of unluky, is still determined to win a battle against a
giant Marlin off the coast of Cuba. Santiago succeeds, but his succeses do not come without great hardship and
struggle. He spends three days being dragged in his skiff by the enomous marlin with minimal food and water, all the
while enduring acute fysical pain, tiredity, and an unending lonelinessess due to the absence of his young friend,
Manolin. It is only after Santiago‘s prize fish is completely devoured by sharks that he returns home to the village
scorners and the safety of Manolin‘s trust. As his suffering and loss compound, we can see that Hemingway‘s quote a
man can be destroyed but not defeated offers a key insight into Santiago‘s life.
As the story begins, we learn that Santiago has gone eighty four days straite without catching a fish. Young
Manolin‘s parents will no longer allow the two to fish together, for they do not want their son being exposed any
more to this type of failure. Santiago and Manolin are deeply saddened by this news, but Santiago does not let the loss
of his friend or the defeat that others see him suffering keep him off the sea. Rather, with bright and shining eyes he
thinks ―maybe today. Every day is a new day (pg. 32), and prepares to catch the biggest fish of his life. This shows
that even though almost all of Santiago‘s aquaintances feel that his fishing career is over, he sees it about to reach its
all time hih. Though he knows he is physically older and weaker than most of his fellow fisherman, he refuses to let
their opinions and stereotypes destroy his confidense and determination.
